This is a quick website that I did that does simply the following:

Allows for users to register for the wedding/event. 
Emails you when someone does in a JSON format
Gives a location of the event
Gives a place where you are registered
Allows you to log in and see who registered

There are some security holes, it is not the best, but it is better than most
